//The first function will take this array, and print it to the console. Make sure to add spaces in-between each word so it looks nice on the console


var fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
function myFunc(){
    return fruits.join(" ");
  
}
myFunc();

  


//The second function will do the same thing, but print the song backwards (starting with the word "pretty": "pretty so I'm myself kiss Gotta", etc.).


var fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
function myFunc(){
return fruits.reverse().join(" ");
}
myFunc();


//The third function will print every other word to the console, i.e. "this that cold Pfeiffer", etc.
