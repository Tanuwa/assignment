<p>Utah (/ˈjuːtɔː/ or Listeni/ˈjuːtɑː/) is a state in the western United States. It became the 45th state admitted to the U.S. on January 4, 1896. Utah is the 13th-largest by area, 31st-most-populous, and 10th-least-densely populated of the 50 United States. Utah has a population of more than 3 million (Census estimate for July 1, 2016), approximately 80% of whom live along the Wasatch Front, centering on the state capital Salt Lake City.[8] Utah is bordered by Colorado to the east, Wyoming to the northeast, Idaho to the north, Arizona to the south, and Nevada to the west. It also touches a corner of New Mexico in the southeast.</p>

<p>Approximately 62% of Utahns are reported to be members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints or LDS (Mormons), which greatly influences Utahn culture and daily life[9] (although only 41.6% are active members of the faith).[citation needed] The LDS Church's world headquarters is located in Salt Lake City. Utah is the only state with a majority population belonging to a single church.</p>

<p>The state is a center of transportation, education, information technology and research, government services, mining, and a major tourist destination for outdoor recreation. In 2013, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated that Utah had the second fastest-growing population of any state.[13] St. George was the fastest-growing metropolitan area in the United States from 2000 to 2005.[14] Utah also has the 14th highest median average income and the least income inequality of any U.S. state. A 2012 Gallup national survey found Utah overall to be the "best state to live in" based on 13 forward-looking measurements including various economic, lifestyle, and health-related outlook metrics.</p>

<p>Utah’s 2011 population increased 41,743 people, or 1.5 percent from 2010, ranking Utah third among states in population growth. Utah grew more than twice as fast as the nation from 2010 to 2011. The United States 2011 population increased by 2,261,698 people, or 0.7 percent from 2010.</p>
