    <p>Your photo session will be relaxed, fun and enjoyable for the whole family. We love to capture how families and couples naturally interact and enjoy each other. Photo sessions are never rushed. The time frame for the session will depend on the session chosen. The best advice we can give you is to make sure you’re well rested on the day of your photo session (that goes for kiddos too!), eat something and stay well hydrated. Believe it or not, bad moods can show up in pictures! The better you feel, the better you’ll look. When you arrive for the photo session, don’t be afraid to dance, skip, twirl and laugh! We want you to enjoy the experience and make it fun!</p>

    Collaborative workspace and the last community darkroom in  Salt Lake City. One of our favorite parts of the entire experience is meeting with you right after we deliver your photographs from the shoot, so that we can see them projected BIG together.  During this meeting we step through your chosen photographs and create a custom order that you will love for years to come.
    
    Please note, for those who travel in for sessions and workshops: we are conveniently located minutes away from hotels and great restaurants – and are only 20 minutes from the airport.
